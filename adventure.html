          <p>
          Experience the natural beauty of South East Queensland's diverse environments* perched atop a mountain bike.
          Perhaps you enjoy riding fire trails, taking in the environment at a leisurely pace. Maybe the thrill of 
          single track calls to you. Or you might take a more masochistic approach, working for the views, preferring
          the feeling of hours of burning quads and stretched hamstrings, climbing your way to the top of 
          mountains that dwarf skyscrapers before experiencing the rush of the descent as you tear back down at a
          speed that has the potential to maim you for life. Whichever it is, SEQA has a location for you.

          The natural environment experienced under the steam of your own two feet.
          Hike through the diverse landscapes that South East Queensland* has to offer. From cool, lush rainforest to
          scorching hot bushland. Trek to the top of mountains underneath enormous canopies and over impressively large 
          boulders to experience dried up waterfalls and stomach churning high ravines that are just waiting to 
          claim your life should you be dumb enough to attempt that perfect selfie; all so that once you reach
          the top you can turn around and come back down. Listen to the exotic calls of the local birdlife, ranging
          from melodic to downright unsettling. All the while avoiding the occasional poisonous reptile and parasitic
          insect while navigating tracks that most people are too lazy to venture onto. SEQA gives you the means to 
          discover and experience the environment in all its natural splendour.
